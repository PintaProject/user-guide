## __About__ ##

__*Pinta Project: Painting Made Simple*__

Pinta is a free, open-source bitmap image editor with a versatile range of uses. It can be used as a basic graphics editor or paint tool similar to MS Paint and Paintbrush for Mac. While Pinta is not as feature rich as some paid software such as Adobe Photoshop, it does work with a design layered approach (unlike other free bitmap image editors) and can be used to draw, colour, and edit pictures. For example, using a screenshot from a display, one can modify the image to include arrows pointing to specific parts of the image. 

Some of the main feature benefits of Pinta include:  

 - Multiple operating system support (Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X).  
 - Layering (most simple bitmap editors don't have this capability). This feature is available in programs like Photoshop and GIMP but Pinta’s system is more user-friendly for all levels of users. Layers help separate and group elements of an image for easy editing.  
 - Full history enabling users to experiment as you can always use the undo feature to easily to revert changes and actions.   
 - Customizable workspace.  
 - Multiple language support.  
 - Add-ins capability ( i.e. can write a custom brush).  
 - Has over 35 adjustments and effects for editing images.

Originally created and maintained by Jonathan Pobst (until version 1.0), a new development community has taken over the project to continue support and updates.
