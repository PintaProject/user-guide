Whether you have used Pinta in the past and want to learn new features or are just getting started this user guide is for you! This guide covers how to use Pinta for simple to intermediate level projects and photo edits. It details how to use basic features ranging from drawing, resizing, and rotating images to more advanced projects like posters, graphics, and professional-level photo editing and effects. To follow are some quick icon button links to the sections of this user guide. However you can also use the left navigation menu or the search function at the top of the page to find topics of interest. Following these quick link icon buttons there is an overview about Pinta and some help resources to refer to beyond this guide. About \u00b6 Pinta Project: Painting Made Simple Pinta is a free, open-source, raster image editor modeled after Paint.NET. Its goal is to provide users with a simple yet powerful way to draw and manipulate images on Linux, Mac, and Windows. Originally created and maintained by Jonathan Pobst (until version 1.0), a new community has taken over the project for the community in hopes of bringing this program to the heights of Paint.Net and beyond! Pinta is an editor with many features including drawing tools, image filters, and color adjustment tools. The focus on usability is reflected in several of the main features of the program: Unlimited undo history. Multiple language support. Flexible toolbar arrangement, including floating as windows or docking around the workspace edge. Unlike some simple image editing software, Pinta also features support for image layers. Project History \u00b6 The development of Pinta began in February 2010 and was driven by Jonathan Pobst, who was working at Novell at the time. In September 2011, Pobst announced that he was no longer interested in developing Pinta. Thus, a new group of enthusiastic developers continued the project in support of the product. Pinta is written in C# and uses the GTK+ toolkit and the Cairo library. The Adjustment, Effect, and Filter features all originally came from Paint.NET but otherwise, the project is original code. Help \u00b6 Contribute \u00b6 If you are interested in contributing to the core of Pinta, like to fix a bug, or tweak existing code, you'll want to make your changes available as pull requests on GitHub. Using Git is an important part of contributing to Pinta, so if you want to read up on this, we recommend reading the excellent documentation on GitHub . If you want an even deeper understanding, read Pro Git . The source code for Pinta development is available on PintaProject GitHub . Fixing a Bug \u00b6 If you plan to work on a bug that has been registered on the Launchpad page , then go to the relevant bug and make sure no one else is already working on it, then leave a comment saying that you are working on it. Creating a Pinta Fork \u00b6 First, you need to make yourself an account with GitHub if you haven't already got one. It is recommended that you use your full name because we need something to put in the credits! Then you fork the PintaProject Repository , and pull the code down to your local machine (all explained here ). Writing, Compiling and Testing \u00b6 This is where the magic happens! Make whatever changes are necessary to the source code, but please do not attempt to clean up the existing code. We are only interested in seeing functional changes to the code. If they are mixed with cosmetic changes, it becomes very difficult to see what has changed. Build your code according to the building instructions , and test it to make sure it does what it's supposed to and doesn't do anything it's not supposed to. Committing your Fix \u00b6 When you are satisfied that you have a great fix to share with the world, commit it to your GitHub fork. (See the second part of Create A Repo .) Make sure that the commit message includes the bug number and a short description. This is vital so that the developers know what exactly they are looking at. Then it will be publicly visible for scrutiny, which comes in handy for the next step. Sending a GitHub Pull Request \u00b6 Pull requests are thoroughly explained here . You will want to send a pull request to the Pinta repository from your fork. When the developers see your request, they will test your solution and if it is good, they will merge it into the Pinta source code. They will then close the bug on Launchpad and add your name to the credits as a contributor and you get a lovely warm feeling inside from helping make the world a better place! Translation \u00b6 Another way to contribute to Pinta without writing a line of code is to translate Pinta into a new language. This is all done through a web page, so all you need to know is a second language. Pinta Translation Page Report Bugs & Feature Requests \u00b6 One way to contribute to Pinta without writing code is to file bugs when things don't work. Bug reports let developers know what needs to be fixed in Pinta. If you have a great idea for a new feature for Pinta, we've got a place where you can submit your ideas and vote on which ones should be implemented. Pinta Bug Tracker Pinta Feature Requests Contact \u00b6 Mailing List \u00b6 You can join Pinta's mailing list on Google Groups: Pinta Project Mailing List Facebook \u00b6 You can join Pinta's Facebook Page and Group: Pinta Facebook Page Pinta Facebook Group Pinta Creators \u00b6 Lead Maintainer: Cameron White (cameronwhite91 at gmail dot com) Developer: Robert Nordan (rpvn at robpvn dot net) Developer: Olivier Dufour (olivier dot duff at gmail dot com) Developer (Project Founder): Jonathan Pobst (monkey at jpobst dot com) Documentation & PR Editor: Johnathan Morlock (johnathan underscore morlock at tsgcomputers dot net)","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-our-pinta-project-user-guide","text":"This user guide was developed to help you speed up your learning curve for Pinta.

Poor exposure, bad lighting, and various other elements can render a perfectly good photo unusable. You can use the auto level adjustment or manually adjust the image yourself to make your pictures pretty again, All of the color adjustment options can be found in the Adjustments menu: We will be using this photo to demonstrate the different color adjustments: Auto level \u00b6 The Auto Level feature equalizes the range of colors in an image. This adjustment is used to normalize the color range of under-exposed (dark) or over-exposed (bright) images. It doesn\u2019t have any configurable options, but if you want to further adjust the tonal range, consider doing it manually using the levels tool. To use Auto Level feature: 1.

After selecting Auto Level , the example photo looks like the following: Manual Level \u00b6 If you aren\u2019t satisfied with the results of the auto level adjustment, you can manually adjust levels, brightness and contrast, and hue and saturation. Levels \u00b6 Levels refers to the color or tonal range of an image. Using level adjustments, users can adjust brightness, contrast, and the range of tones within an image. This adjustment is used to alter the color range of the image, including gamma adjustments, on a channel-by-channel basis. The most common adjustments made using Levels include changing a picture's input, and outputting white point, black point, and grey point. The white point of an image is the brightest color that appears in the image. The black point is the darkest color that appears in the image. The grey point represents the average color across the entire image and is only found on the right side (Output) of the dialog. Each of these color points of an image may be adjusted independently using Levels . To adjust levels: 1. Go to Adjustments > Levels . The following Levels dialog box will appear: Select the desired input and output levels. Brightness / Contrast \u00b6 Brightness control is used to make an image lighter or darker. Contrast control is used or to make an image more vivid or dull: it\u2019s the difference between dark colors and light colors. Low contrast images have very muted tones or colors, whereas high contrast images have vibrant tones. To adjust the brightness and contrast levels: 1. Go to Adjustments > Brightness / Contrast . The following dialog box will then appear: A dialog box includes two sliders with one option for brightness and a second option for contrast. Drag the Brightness slider to the right to increase brightness or to the left to decrease brightness. Drag the Contrast slider to the right to increase contrast and to the left to decrease contrast. Hue / Saturation \u00b6 Hue adjustments can be made to correct color. Saturation adjustments can control the vibrancy of color tones in an image. Lightness adjustments can be used to alter the exposure of an image. To adjust the hue and saturation levels: 1. Go to Adjustments > Hue / Saturation . The following dialogue box will appear with a slider for hue, saturation and lightness. The green arrows to the right of the sliders can be used to reset each slider to its original value: Drag the Hue slider to the right and left to adjust the hue. The Hue slider rotates the colors used in an image as if they were on a color wheel, allowing the current palette to be cycled around. The Hue slider will only affect the colored parts of an image: it doesn't affect anything in black and white.

Drag the Lightness slider to the right to increase lightness, and to the left to decrease lightness.","title":"Hue / Saturation"},{"location":"concept/","text":"Basic Concepts \u00b6 This section provides a brief introduction to the basic concepts used in Pinta and other image editors. The concepts presented here are explained in much greater detail within the documentation, so you can refer to the side navigation or search bar to look for specific topics and instructions. Image \u00b6 The term \"image\" is not the same meaning that we think of images when it comes to image editing. An image is a basic structure of layers used by Pinta and any image editor. Roughly speaking, an \u201cimage\u201d corresponds to a single image file, such as a PNG or JPEG file. You can also think of an image as corresponding to a single display window. It is not possible to have a single-window display more than one image or for an image to have no window displaying it. Instead of thinking of it as a sheet of paper with a picture on it, think of it as more like a stack of papers, or in our case, a stack of \u201clayers\u201d. So a final composition of an image will have a sum of all visible stacks of layers. In terms of editing photography, the photograph that is imported into the workspace would still be added as a layer and does not stand as an image until the project is exported as an image file. Layers \u00b6 Pinta uses layers to create a composite image. Think of layers as a stack of transparent papers. Each individual paper can contain a separate element which will form part of the overall image. The stacked layers in Pinta are organized as if they are viewed from above. Therefore, the layer arrangement is extremely important. An opaque image on a layer higher up the stack will block or obscure the image or images in the layers lower in the stack. You can draw on each paper but still see the content of the other sheets through the transparent areas. Intermediate users often deal with images containing many layers. Layers do not need to be opaque and they do not cover the entirety of an image. So when you look at an image's display, you may see more than just the top layer: you may see elements of many layers. When working with layers, you cannot work on multiple layers at the same time: it'll be a single layer each time you switch layers. When you make edits to that single layer, you are working on an active layer - no other layer will be affected or changed by that definition except the active layer. Selection \u00b6 When modifying an image, you only want a part of the image to be affected. The \u201cselection\u201d mechanism makes this possible. Each image has its own selection, which you normally see as a moving dashed line separating the selected parts from the unselected parts. As with the idea of images, selections are done by layers to manipulate selected objects or areas. A large component of learning how to use Pinta effectively is honing the art of making good selections \u2014 selections that contain exactly what you need and nothing more. Because selection-handling is so centrally important, you can treat the selection tool as though it were a channel for color, placement, sizing, cloning, etc.","title":"Basic Concepts"},{"location":"concept/#basic-concepts","text":"This section provides a brief introduction to the basic concepts used in Pinta and other image editors.

The layer we currently work on is called an active layer . We select an active layer by clicking on the layer listed under the Layers Window to be able to edit that particular layer. You can only edit or manipulate the layer that is active: no other layer will be affected or changed. A common mistake made when using layers is trying to edit an image that is not active. So keep in mind as you are learning to use Pinta that image manipulations only affect the active layer. You can always tell which image is active by looking at the selected thumbnail in the Layers Window. Layers Window : Layers Menu : Layer Properties : Change Layer Name \u00b6 Double-click the layer from the Layers Window or click on Layer Properties... from the Layers Menu . Enter the name in the text box. Select OK . Hide/Unhide Layers \u00b6 While editing, there are moments when you need to hide or unhide a layer in order to work more efficiently on the other layers. To do so, you can toggle the checkbox in any layer you need to display in the workspace. Choose the layer to hide or unhide under the Layers Window. Check or uncheck the box. Flipping Layers \u00b6 Choose the layer to flip horizontally or vertically under the Layers Window. Select Flip Horizontal or Flip Vertical . Rotating Layers \u00b6 Choose the layer to rotate under the Layer Window. Select Rotate / Zoom Layer... . Select the angle in the slider or enter an angle degree to rotate. Select OK to apply the change. Change Layer Opacity \u00b6 Double-click the layer from the Layers Window or click on Layer Properties... from the Layers Menu . Select the opacity in the slider or enter the percentage of opacity. Select OK to apply the change. Apply Blend Mode \u00b6 A layer's blend mode specifies how it is blended with the layers immediately below it in the layer stack. Changing the Blend Mode on a single layer can radically alter the composite image. The order of the layers in the layers stack is important when using layer blend modes. Layer A blended over Layer B is not the same as Layer B blended over Layer A - even if the same blend mode is used. Double-click the layer from the Layers Window or click on Layer Properties... from the Layers Menu . Select the style of blend mode in the drop-down menu. Select OK to apply the change. The Blend Mode drop-down list offers 14 blend modes. We'll be using two images for the blend mode examples: a background layer and a top layer. Background Layer : Top Layer : Normal \u00b6 This is the default and standard blend mode. Each pixel in the layer is blended with the composition depending on its alpha value. Multiply \u00b6 Each pixel's RGB component intensity is multiplied with the pixel value from the composition. The result of this blend mode is always darker than the original. White pixels in the blend layer are effectively rendered transparent by the Multiply blend. Additive \u00b6 Each pixel's RGB component intensity is added to the intensity of the pixel values from the composition. The Additive blend has the effect of brightening pixels in the final composition. Black pixels in the blend layer are rendered as transparent by the Additive blend. Color Burn \u00b6 This blend mode has the effect of making dark pixels darker while lighter pixels must be blended with other light-colored pixels in order to remain bright. Color Dodge \u00b6 This can be thought of as the opposite of Color Burn. Lighter pixels retain their brightness while darker pixels must be blended with other dark pixels in order to remain dark. Reflect \u00b6 This blend mode can be used for adding shiny objects or areas of light. Black pixels in the blend layer are ignored as if they were transparent. Glow \u00b6 This is the reverse of the Reflect mode: it works the same as swapping the layer positions and using Reflect. Glow effectively brightens the composition by the amount of brightness in the blend layer. Black pixels in the blend layer are rendered as if they were transparent. Overlay \u00b6 This is a combination of Screen and Multiply modes which uses the blend pixel intensity to determine the result. For darker colors, this acts like Multiply. For lighter colors, this acts like Screen. Difference \u00b6 The counterpart to Additive blending. The layer pixel's intensity is subtracted from the composition pixel's intensity resulting in darker colors. Subtraction could produce a negative intensity which is unable to be displayed, so an absolute value is returned. Thus, both \"white minus black\" and \"black minus white\" will both produce white. Difference blend is often useful when using the Clouds effect. Negation \u00b6 At first glance this seems similar to Difference, however it actually produces the opposite effect. Instead of making colors darker, it will make them brighter. Lighten \u00b6 The lightest pixel of either the blend layer or the composition is used. Darken \u00b6 The darkest pixel of either the blend layer or the composition is used. Screen \u00b6 This can be thought of as the opposite of the Multiply blend mode. It is used to make pixels brighter, with black being effectively transparent. Xor \u00b6 This is short for \"exclusive OR\", which is an advanced blending mode that is primarily used for image analysis. Pixels in the blend layer which exactly match the composition will be rendered black. Where differences exist, colors are shown.","title":"Edit Layer Properties"},{"location":"edit/#edit-layer-properties","text":"In the Layers Window, we work on each single layer.

Glow : use to overlay an illuminating glow as if the image were strongly backlit. Sharpen : use to sharpen the image by removing softness. Soften Portrait : use to make the portrait lighting appear more diffused. Blur : use to make the image appear blurred. Distort : use to warp, twist, transform, or convolute an image. Artistic Medium : use to make the image appear as if it were painted or sketched. Render : use to render clouds or fractals. Stylize : use to change the image based on edge detection. All of the effects can be found in the Effects menu: To illustrate all of the effects, we'll be using this photo of KFC. Glow \u00b6 The Glow effect is used to give images an inner glow by brightening lighter tones and muting color saturation, making the image appear as though it were strongly back-lit. A dialog box populates with three sliders, radius, brightness, and contrast. Go to Effects > Photo and select Glow . The Glow dialog box will appear. Adjust the Radius slider to control the strength of the effect. Higher values yield stronger effect results. Drag slider to the right to increase effect strength. Drag slider to the left to decrease effect strength. Adjust the Brightness slider to control the intensity of the illumination. Higher values yield brighter images and lower values yield darker images. Drag slider to the right to increase brightness. Drag slider to the left to decrease brightness. Adjust the Contrast slider to control the color range, making an image appear more vivid or dull. Higher contrast values yield more vibrant tones and lower values yield duller tones. Drag slider to the right to increase contrast. Drag slider to the left to decrease contrast. Sharpen: \u00b6 The Sharpen effect is used to reduce softness and emphasize texture in an image to draw in viewer focus. A dialog box populates with a strength slider. The strength slider controls how pronounced the edges in an image appear, increasing the contrast of edges. Go to Effects > Photo and select Sharpen . The Sharpen dialog box will appear. Adjust the Sharpness Amount to control how sharp the image appears. Drag slider to the right to increase sharpness. Drag slider to the left to decrease sharpness. Soften Portrait \u00b6 The Soften Portrait effect is used to soften images as if the lighting were diffused, adding a subtle glow. Go to Effects > Photo and select Soften Portrait . The Soften Portrait dialog box will appear. Adjust the Softness slider to control the strength of the effect. Higher values yield a softer, more blurred image. Drag slider to the right to increase softness. Drag slider to the left to decrease softness. Adjust the Lighting slider to control the strength of the illumination. Higher values yield stronger lighting and brighter images. Drag slider to the right to increase lighting. Drag slider to the left to decrease lighting. Adjust the Warmth slider to control the color of the lighting. Higher values yield more warmth, making tones appear more golden. Lower values yield more coolness, making tones appear bluer. Drag slider to the right to increase warmth. Drag slider to the left to decrease warmth. Here's the image before and after using the Soften Portrait effect: Blur: \u00b6 There are six Blur effect options: Fragment , Gaussian , Motion , Radial , Unfocus , and Zoom . These can be applied to the whole image or a selected area. Fragment \u00b6 The Fragment blur effect superimposes copies or \u201cfragments\u201d of the image or selected area. Copies or \"fragments\" of the image are superimposed over the original. This blur can be useful when creating an unfocussed multi-viewed version of an image. The effect is not unlike modern interpretations of insect-like vision and could be used to fake \"drunken\" or \"semi-conscious\" vision. Go to Effects > Blur and select Fragment . The Fragment dialog box will appear. Adjust the Fragments slider to control how many fragments appear. A higher value yields more fragments. Drag slider to the right to increase number of fragments. Drag slider to the left to decrease number of fragments. Adjust the Distance slider to control how close or far fragments appear from one another. A higher value yields more distance between fragments. Drag slider to the right to increase distance. Drag slider to the left to decrease distance. Adjust the Rotation circle slider to control the angle at which the fragments sit. It can be rotated 360 degrees. Gaussian \u00b6 The Gaussian Blur effect applies a defocusing blur to the image or selected area. Go to Effects > Blur and select Gaussian . The Gaussian dialog box will appear. Adjust the Radius slider to control how widely and how strongly the blur is applied. A higher value yields a stronger effect. Drag slider to the right to increase blur strength. Drag slider to the left to decrease blur strength. Motion \u00b6 The Motion Blur effect creates the illusion of motion in an image or selected area. A dialog box populates with two sliders, for angle and distance. Go to Effects > Blur and select Motion . The Motion dialog box will appear. Adjust the Angle circle slider to control the angle at which the motion blur appears. It can be rotated 360 degrees. Adjust the Distance slider to control the width of the blur, how far the effect shifts the original pixels. A higher value yields a wider effect. Drag slider to the right to increase motion blur effect. Drag slider to the left to decrease motion blur effect. Radial \u00b6 The Radial Blur effect is like the motion blur, but rather than following a linear path, it follows a circular one. Go to Effects > Blur and select Radial Blur . The Radial Blur dialog box will appear. Adjust the Angle circle slider to control the angle at which the blur appears. It can be rotated 360 degrees. Adjust the Center option box to configure where the effect will be interpreted from, setting the focus or center of the blur. Adjust the Quality slider to define the quality of the blur. A higher value yields higher quality. It is recommended to use low quality for previews, small images, and small angles. High quality should be used for final quality, large images, and large angles. Drag slider to the right to increase quality. Drag slider to the left to decrease quality. Unfocus \u00b6 The Unfocus Blur effect is like the Gaussian blur but yields a more dreamy or unfocused look to the image or selected area. Go to Effects > Blur and select Unfocus . The Unfocus dialog box will appear. Adjust the Radius slider to control the strength of the effect. A higher value yields a stronger blur effect. Drag slider to the right to increase blur strength. Drag slider to the left to decrease blur strength. Zoom \u00b6 The Zoom Blur effect is used to give the appearance of motion towards the focal point of an image, as if the viewer were closing in on the focal point. It's like the Motion blur but applied outwards from a central point. Go to Effects > Blur and select Zoom Blur . The Zoom Blur dialog box will appear. Adjust the Amount slider to control how strong the blur appears. A higher value yields a stronger effect. Drag slider to the right to increase blur strength. Drag slider to the left to decrease blur strength. Adjust the Offset option box to configure where the effect will be interpreted from, setting the focus or center of the blur. Distort: \u00b6 There are six Distort options: [ Bulge ](effects.md#bulge, Frosted Glass , Pixelate , Polar Inversion Tile Reflection , and Twist . These can be applied to the whole image or a selected area. Bulge \u00b6 The Bulge effect makes the image or selected area swell or shrink, similar to a fisheye or reverse fisheye effect. Go to Effects > Distort and select Bulge . The Bulge dialog box will appear. Adjust the Amount slider to control how strong the swelling or shrinking appears. A higher value yields a stronger effect. Drag slider to the right to increase swelling. Drag slider to the left to decrease swelling. Adjust the Offset option box to configure where the effect will be interpreted from, setting the focus or center of the bulge. Frosted Glass \u00b6 The Frosted Glass effect makes the image or selected area look as though it were being viewed through frosted glass. Go to Effects > Distorted and select Frosted Glass . The Frosted Glass dialog box will appear. Adjust the Amount slider to control the harshness and number of displaced pixels, giving off the frosted effect. A higher value yields a more frosted, pixelated look. Drag slider to the right to increase frosted appearance. Drag slider to the left to decrease frosted appearance. Pixelate \u00b6 The Pixelate effect gives the image or selected area a pixelated look, reducing detail by enlarging regularly sampled pixels. Go to Effects > Distorted and select Pixelate . The Pixelate dialog box will appear. Adjust the Cell Size slider to control the size of the pixels. A higher value yields larger pixels, and lower values yield smaller, finer pixels. Drag slider to the right to increase pixel size. Drag slider to the left to decrease pixel size. Polar Inversion \u00b6 The Polar Inversion effect applies a transformation between Cartesian and Polar coordinate systems, resulting in a positional transformation which recursively wraps the image around itself in an endlessly repeating pattern. Go to Effects > Distorted and select Polar Inversion . The Polar Inversion dialog box will appear. Adjust the Amount slider to control the strength of the effect. A higher value yields a stronger inversion. Drag slider to the right to increase strength. Drag slider to the left to decrease strength. Adjust the Offset option box to configure where the effect will be interpreted from, setting the focus or center of the inversion. The Edge Behavior drop-down selection defines how the effect behaves as the transformation reaches, then exceeds the edge of the canvas. Tile Reflection \u00b6 The Tile Reflection effect makes the image or selection appear as if it were reflected in a wall of mirrored tiles. Go to Effects > Distorted and select Tile Reflection . The Tile Reflection dialog box will appear. Adjust the Rotation circle slider to control the angle at which the tiles appear. It can be rotated 360 degrees. Adjust the Tile Size slider to control how big or how small the tiles appear: they always remain square. A higher value yields larger tiles. Drag slider to the right to increase tile size. Drag slider to the left to decrease tile size. Adjust Intensity slider to control the curvature of each tile, determining how much of the surrounding are reflected in each tile. A higher value yields curvier tiles, making the image appear more abstracted. Drag slider to the right to increase tile curvature. Drag slider to the left to decrease tile curvature. Twist \u00b6 The Twist effect mimics winding the image around the center point of the image. Go to Effects > Distorted and select Twist . The Twist dialog box will appear. Adjust the Amount slider to control the intensity of the twist. Numbers closer to 0 make the effect less intense, with 0 leaving the image unaltered. Adjust the Antialias slider to control the amount of detail. A higher value yields a smoother appearance, while lower values yield a more jagged, pixelated appearance. Drag slider to the right to increase smoothness. Drag slider to the left to decrease smoothness. Artistic Medium: \u00b6 There are 3 Artistic Medium options: Ink Sketch , Oil Painting , and Pencil Sketch , all mimicking traditional artistic mediums. Ink Sketch \u00b6 The Ink Sketch effect makes the image appear as if it were drawn using a pen. Go to Effects > Artistic and select Ink Sketch . The Ink Sketch dialog box will appear. Adjust the Ink Outline slider to control the weight of the outline or edging. Drag slider to the right to increase outline strength. Drag slider to the left to decrease outline strength. Adjust the Coloring slider to control how much of the original image\u2019s color bleeds through, higher values yield higher saturation. Drag slider to the right to increase color. Drag slider to the left to decrease color. Oil Painting \u00b6 The Oil Painting effect makes the image appear as if it were painted with oil paints. Go to Effects > Artistic and select Oil Painting . The Oil Painting dialog box will appear. Adjust the Brush Size slider to control the size of the paintbrush tip, larger values yield larger strokes and smaller values yield finer strokes. Drag slider to the right to increase brush size. Drag slider to the left to decrease brush size. Adjust the Coarseness slider to control how much detail is captured in the transformation. A larger value yields a more detailed oil painting render and a smaller value yields a less detailed oil painting render. Drag slider to the right to increase detail. Drag slider to the left to decrease detail. Pencil Sketch \u00b6 The Pencil Sketch effect makes the image appear as though it were sketched with a pencil. Go to Effects > Artistic and select Pencil . The Pencil dialog box will appear. Adjust the Pencil Tip slider to control the sharpness of the virtual pencil. A larger value yields a blunter tip, making lines thicker and heavier. A smaller value yields a sharper tip, making lines finer, and the image appear lighter. Drag slider to the right to increase line thickness. Drag slider to the left to decrease line thickness. The Color Range slider has no effect on the image as it\u2019s generated in greyscale. This slider is arbitrary and can be ignored. Render: \u00b6 There are 3 Render options: Clouds , Julia Fractal , and Mandelbrot Fractal , these three effects create completely new renderings, replacing all color information in the active layer or selection. Clouds \u00b6 The Clouds effect renders a randomized cloud pattern to the layer or desired selection. Go to Effects > Render and select Clouds . The Cloud dialog box will appear. Adjust the Scale slider to control the size of clouds. Higher values yield larger clouds and lower values yield finer clouds. Drag slider to the right to increase cloud size. Drag slider to the left to decrease cloud size. Adjust the Power slider to control how coarse or how fluffy the clouds appear, dealing with their texture.

Release the mouse button once you have completed drawing your desired shape. If you do not end at your starting point ( A ), Pinta will default to drawing a straight line between the end point ( B ) and start point of the closed shape (refer to Draw Freeform Shape Example diagram below).","title":"Freeform Shapes"},{"location":"overview/","text":"General Overview \u00b6 When the Pinta workspace first loads, you'll notice it has an uncluttered layout that is similar to MS Paint, but has more advanced features in comparison.

It's recommended to invest in a drawing tablet if you want to use the program to create digital art, but using the good old-fashioned mouse is still perfectly fine to create your art as well. In this section, we'll be guiding you on setting up your workspace and understanding how to get started on creating a project (it could be editing photographs to painting landscapes to creating a cartoon character). If you aren't familiar with the tools and the menus, we recommend to check out the General Overview page to learn more and give context to the workspace. Default Setup \u00b6 Open Pinta if you haven't already and you will see a blank workspace that looks like this: As you can see from the Layers window, you have one layer called Background . When you want to work on an illustration or a photograph, you will need to create a new layer to work on because you want to keep the background layer for any background elements that will show in your final composite image. T Once you have setup your new layer, you can start working on your project in that new layer or any other new layers you have created. As well you can import an image to a layer from a file . Setup with a Custom Canvas \u00b6 When you open Pinta, it starts with a default canvas size of 640 x 480. You can create a custom size depending on the project you are creating. For example, you may want to create a banner such as this: To customize the canvas size, create a new image and select the desired sizing of your canvas. Select New... in the Toolbar or go to File > New... . Select a preset to change the canvas size or customize with the listed options to modify the width, height, orientation, and the type of background. You can see a preview of it in the window when you are making the modifications. Select OK to apply the change. Setup with a Screenshot \u00b6 You can create a project with a screenshot of your screen(s). If you have multiple screens, it will also capture those too so it's recommended to use the cropping tool to keep what you need. Go to File > New Screenshot... . 2. Choose the length of the delay you require for the capture to start. 3. Select OK to capture. Customizing the Workspace \u00b6 Before you begin to work on your project, you can customize how your workspace looks to make the area easier for you to use. Using the View menu , you can: Check or uncheck the Toolbar to hide or view it. Check or uncheck the Pixel Grid to turn on or off the pixel-sized gridlines (mainly used for pixel editing). Check or uncheck the Rulers to hide or view the workspace pixel-sized rulers. Change your ruler measurement in case you needed to use inch or centimeters instead of pixels. Select the zooming function if you need to take a closer look at your work area. Select Normal Size to view your image at 100% zoom. Select Best Fit to view the image in its entirety. Check or uncheck your workspace tools and windows to hide or view any features you may need. Saving the New Project \u00b6 Once you have created your project in the workspace, save your progress as an ORA file so that you can continue it the next time you are editing the same project. ORA stands for OpenRaster Image. The purpose of this file type is to save the image project with the layers still intact so you can utilize the file in Pinta or any raster graphic editor. If the file is saved as a PNG, JPEG, or TIFF as an example, it becomes a final compostion of the image and the visible layers will be flatten together to export to a final image file. To export the file as an image , please see the exporting information under the Exporting Project page. Go to File > Save As... . Choose the directory to save the project in. Select OpenRaster image ( .ora, .ORA) from the drop-down list. Select Save to save the new project. Using Undo or Redo Functions \u00b6 You can undo and redo any actions taken in Pinta: - Go to Edit and select Undo or Redo - Select Undo or Redo from Toolbar . - Select shortcuts for undo CTRL + Z and redo CTRL + Y . - Select the action in the History Window list - skip back to undo a row of actions and skip ahead to redo those actions. Your actions are unlimited so you can undo the whole history if you wanted to.

Text can be shown with or without an outline. Advanced functions like aligning text images, editing text after you move away from it, or moving text from one layer to another are not included. Pinta\u2019s text tool does not automatically make a layer of its own in the workspace. As a result, it is recommended to first create a new layer before adding text as it will be easier to remove the text if desired in the future. How to Add Text \u00b6 Select the Text Tool from the Tool Menu options. After the Text Tool is selected, the Text Tool bar should appear on the top menu. Select the desire font, font size, font style, text justification, text style and text outline width from the Text Tool bar menu options. Font & Font Size : Select the desired font and font size (6-96) from the font and font size drop-down lists. Bold, Italic, Underline : Select the desired font style. Text Justification : If you intend to have multiple lines of text, select left, centre or right text justification to align text within a text box. With only one line of text the selection of this option will have no effect. Text Style : Select one of the four options from the Text Style pulldown menu. Normal : Text characters are colored with the primary color. Normal and Outline : Text character is colored with the primary color and the character outline is colored using the secondary color.

If you have trouble setting up or understanding how to start, go back to Setting Up Workspace for a quick workspace guide. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create our first project - a final image. These key ingredients will help us achieve our goal: Working with layers. Making selections. Penciling and painting. Working with color. Adding text and shapes. And utilizing various common tools. By the end of this tutorial, we will create this little secret burger: Although this is a tutorial on creating a graphic image, this is not a drawing tutorial so we cannot guarantee if your drawing will look exactly as our image. If you haven't setup your workspace yet, it is highly recommended because this tutorial will assume the workspace has been configured. See Setting Up Workspace to learn more. To keep the images consistent, we'll be drawing a very basic burger. It should have at least a top bun, a bottom bun, cheese, a patty, tomatoes and lettuce. This tutorial can take at least 2-3 hours to complete for some new users to Pinta. So if you need to rearrange your time, this is the moment. Some may find that by doing this project, they're able to quickly learn the various capabilities Pinta has to offer. Alternatively, if you don't have the time to do this tutorial, you can look up topics of interest in the user manual to suit your specific image editing needs. Sketching \u00b6 The tools we'll use for sketching are: Pencil Eraser Lasso Select Shapes Lines Text Now we can get started on sketching our little secret burger! Using the default canvas layout: Select Add Layer to add a new layer in the Layers window. Select Layer 2 from the Layers window . Make sure the Background layer is below the new layer (use the up and down arrows on the Layers window to rearrange layers if necessary). Double-click the layer to open Layer Properties dialog box and type Sketch for the name of the layer. Select OK to close the window. Select Sketch to make it an active layer. Select Pencil to start sketching your burger. Use Eraser to remove any markings not needed. Change the eraser size as needed in the Tools Settings Bar . Use any Selection tool to move any sketches around. In this case, we used the Lasso Select to move the text box up higher. Use Shapes , Lines and Text to help create your sketch if that is your preference. You can also upload a hand-drawn sketch as well. Go to Import File into Layer to learn more. Go to File > Save As... to save your progress as a project *.ora file and it should look something like this: Before we move on to inking over the sketch, we want to change the color of the pencil sketch so that it's easier to see between the (black) inking and the (black) sketch itself. Blue would be a nice color to see through, but use whatever color you prefer. Create a new layer. Make sure this new layer is above Sketch layer. Open Layer Properties dialog box for the new layer and enter Color Sketch in the text box. Select Color Burn under the Blend Mode drop-down list and select OK . Select Color Burn to make it an active layer. Select Paint Bucket tool and choose a Palette color. Click on the project to apply the color on the Color Burn layer. Save your progress and it should look like this: As you can see from the thumbnail in the Layers Window , the Color Burn layer is fully colored in but from the drawing, it only burned in the color onto the pencil sketch itself. This can only work when the layers are stacked accordingly and properties of the layers are modified. Otherwise, the color would just lay on top of the sketch layer, completely covering it in its normal state. Inking \u00b6 The tools we'll use for inking are: Pencil Eraser Shapes Lines This part of the process, we'll be inking the rough sketch itself so that all the lines needed are more distinct. Create a new layer in the Layers Window . Make sure this new layer is above Color Sketch layer. Open Layer Properties dialog box for the new layer and enter Ink in the text box. Select OK to close the window. Select Ink to make it an active layer. Select Paint Brush to start inking over your rough sketches. Same as with sketching, use Eraser to remove any markings not needed. Use Shapes and Lines to help create your objects if needed, but we will skip on the Text tool for a later step. Save your progress and it should look something like this: Coloring \u00b6 The tools we'll use for coloring are: Burger image reference Palette Color Picker Paint Brush Eraser Gradient This is now the fun part: coloring! For the purposes of this tutorial, we also added in this burger image for you to download as a color image reference for when we pick colors. Go ahead and right-click on the image to save the image down below: Bun \u00b6 Now let's begin with the bun: Uncheck the box for Sketch in the Layers Window to hide the layer from view. We won't be needing it for this process. Create a new layer. Make sure this new layer is below Ink layer. Double-click the new layer to open Layer Properties dialog box and under the name type Bun Color . Select OK to close the window. Select Bun Color to make it an active layer. Go to File > Open... and open the saved burger image reference. Select Color Picker to pick the bun color from the reference image and switch back to the burger project under the Image window. You can create and modify your own color by double-clicking on the primary or secondary color boxes under Palette . Select Paint Brush to color in the entire burger. You can enlarge the size of the Paint Brush in the Tools Settings Bar to speed up the process. Select Eraser to clean up any color that doesn't belong. Save your progress and it should look something like this: Cheese, Tomatoes & Lettuce \u00b6 We'll now work on the cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce: Create a new layer. Make sure this new layer is below Ink and above Bun Color layers. Open Layer Properties dialog box for the new layer and enter Other Color in the text box. Select OK to close the window. Select Other Color to make it an active layer. Using the same concept as the bun, select Color Picker to pick the colors from the reference image to apply to the project for the cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce. Select Paint Brush and Eraser to color in the appropriate areas. Save your progress and it should look like this: Patty \u00b6 For the patty, we want to create a gradient to replicate the grilled side of the patty: Create a new layer. Make sure this new layer is below Ink and above Other Color layers. Open Layer Properties for the new layer, enter Patty Color , and enter an Opacity value of 90. Select OK to close the window. Select Patty Color to make it an active layer. Using the same concept as earlier, select Color Picker to pick the patty color from the reference image and switch back to the project. Right-click the black color in the Palette to set the secondary color and select Gradient . Click and hold on the drawing in any area while moving the cursor in different directions to form a gradient. Let go once you're satisfied with the way the color is distributed. Repeat if necessary. Select Eraser to erase anything that is outside of the patty. Resize Eraser to get the required size. Double-click on Patty Color in the Layers window and enter Opacity value of 100. Select OK to close the window. Save your progress and the whole process should look like this: Shadows and Highlights \u00b6 This area is optional so you can skip to the next section if you want. Now let's add some dimension by adding shadows and highlights to the burger: Create a new layer called Shadows and another called Highlights . Make sure both layers are below Ink and above Patty Color layers. Select the corresponding active layer to apply shadows and highlights. Select Color Picker to pick the bun color (or cheese, tomatoes, lettuce). Double-click the primary color in the Palette and modify the color to a lighter color for Highlights and repeat with the darker color for Shadows . Click OK to close the window. Select Paint Brush and Eraser to color in the appropriate areas. Resize the two tools to a smaller size for precision. Save your progress. Adding Texts & Shapes \u00b6 The tools we'll use for adding texts and shapes are: Shapes Lines Texts Eraser From here, we can start to add these elements against the sketch layer again. Create a new layer. Make sure this new layer is below Ink layer. Check the box for Sketch in the Layers Window to unhide the sketch. Select Ellipse and select Line to create a speech bubble over the sketched speech bubble. Select Eraser to erase a part of the ellipse that's connected to the lines to complete the speech bubble. Select Text and modify the font in the Tools Settings Bar . Click inside the speech bubble to create a line of text. Text can only be modified before you place it on the drawing so use the History Window to track where you want to Undo and Redo your actions. Text can be done line by line so you will need to play around with Undo and Redo until you position your text where you want it to be. Uncheck the box for Sketch to hide the sketch as we'll no longer need the sketch layer to view. Save your progress and it should look something like this: Finished Image \u00b6 Your little secret burger is now complete! You can change the Background layer to whatever color you want. Just make sure you select it as an active layer before you begin. What we did here was apply a primary blue with secondary light-blue gradient. You can now Save your image as any image file format besides .ORA and use it externally now.","title":"Tutorial"},{"location":"tutorial/#tutorial","text":"Note Before we begin, please make sure you have setup and understood your workspace.
